DESCRIPTION: Structural model of Usutu Virus in-host (sparrows).
Variables
-T is the number uninfected target cells per mL
-E is the number of eclipse phase infected cells per mL
-I is the number of virus producing infected cells per mL
-V is the virus PFU per mL

Parameters
-beta is the rate target cells are infected
-k is the rate that eclipse phase cells become infectious
-p is the viral production rate
-delta is the infected cell death rate
-c is the viral clearance rate
